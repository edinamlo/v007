- media clue extractor, what found 2014?



Help me understand how to process this please



1. extractor_1_Resolution extract = good



2. Extractor_2_anime_group:

I think it needs to be prefix  and suffix anime relese groups parser

Checks res_extracted_left_side and res_extracted_right_side... If found, gets removed, 

Output: is_anime: true/false

cleaned_anime_extracted_left_side (without the group)

cleaned_anime_extracted_right_side



3. If extractor_2 = true then run this extractor_3_anime_episode

Output: is_anime: true/false if also true then is_anime confirmed

cleaned_anime_extracted_left_side (without the anime_episode)



4. If extractor_2_ = false then run extractor_4_tv_show_season_episode to find all types of TV show season and episodes patterns using cleaned_res_extracted_left_side , search the web.



Output: is_tv_show: true/false

cleaned_tv_show_extracted_left_side (without the season/episode)
