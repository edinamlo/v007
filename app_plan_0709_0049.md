This is very complex, but wondering how close we can get to a great parser, but small and clean 

Maybe if we have in one file for now, first stage

# Rules
1. Websites starts with www. and has a string then another . So basically www.word.wor (then end has 3 or 2 chr, or 3 followed by another 2 like .com.us ) can be inside square brackets etc

##1st stage
cleaner_1_square_brackets_and_media_type_clues_for_anime
Grab everything inside square brackets []
If start the start prefix inside [] check its a website, if not, remove, then check against known_clues.json for anime release_groups and 
mark the item as possibility=anime 
if no matching prefix for anime_release group and media_type=anime if a anime release groups in in kwown_clues

Print
cleaner_1_
- found: [all bits inside square brackets at the start of string]
- anime_clue: true/false clue: if true, write the clue here including []
- cleaner_1_: Saved: anime release group if found - removed: List all [] removed from start of string

cleaner_1_final_output: cleaned_1_name, is_anime: true/false (if theres a prefix in square brackets that is not a website and is not on the known clues file, then anime_probability: true, 

##2nd stage
cleaner_2_replace_square_brackets_at_end
Same, but replace square brackets at the end with a space? Is this better?
Sometimes we might have anime episode inside square brackets like [02] etc, so maybe replace [ with a space would be best?

Out put it like on stage 1
##3rd stage


Can you create this then I can see the results before we do the next stages?
